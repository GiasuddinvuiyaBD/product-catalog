	How are you all i seem to everyone is good.
Today i am going to talk about my product catalog project.

well let's start, At first i maked seperated 3 staps my all project 
1.Step One is i will take the value of user and then i will set and database and UI.
2.Step Number two is that, I have validated input field
3.Step number three is that, I have removed date form UI and Databases

This are three big part in my application.

Now i am interested to talk about my this three steps
1.Number one step is i have taken Data form user and set it on Database and show it in UI.

At fisrt have selected all the element using document.querySelector. Then i have taken submitBtnElm and is addEventListener. After that i have maked smallest step for complete step number one. For example, i have taking a lot of function such as resivingValueFormInput(),validationInputBox(name,price),seperatedisErrorFun(isError,name,price) so this type of funciton i have taken for clean coding. Using this funciton for taking data form usesr and storing it in my database as well as showing it to UI. So this way i have completed my big step number 1.




2. Step number two.
In this step have solved validation part. Be to true talk about this step it was every intersting part for me in this project.Well let's talk about it. At fist i have taken a function and resive two parameter validationInputBox(name,price). Then i valided conditions and  setting error message as well as sound effect. So this way i have finished this steps.


3. step three was very difficult and intersting to me. In this part i have completed DELETE step. At i have selected listItemsElm and set's addEventListener. Inside of it i have done event deligation after words i taken a function and resive a parameter getProductId(evt). This function have taken the unique id form database. On the other hand i have taken anther function call geetingParrent(evt) it's resive the parent element of the unique id and then i have deleted item form databese and ui.
