	How are you all i seem to everyone is good.
Today i would like to talk about my development part. Today i am using localStorage for storing date form user.

Number 1 spep i am converting all the database date to string using JSON.stringify() method like this localStorage.setItem('product-list',JSON.stringify(database)). After that i have converted it normal data using JSON.parse() method. like this let database = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('product-list')) || [].

After completed this i have showing item to the UI using localStorage and as well as remove item form localStroge So this type of features i have added in my project. 


Here is the link of project : https://github.com/GiasuddinvuiyaBD/product-catalog.git
